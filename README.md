Calculation Variancea and Covariance of X and Y values 


Covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables(x,y). 

If (result == positiveNum) : 
 { x and y value is correlated to each other. which means 
    if x value gets higher, 
      it impacts to y and y value also gets higher. }
      
      
else if (result == negative ) :
{ x and y value is negatively correlated. So, if x gets higher --> y gets lower }


else { they are not correlated to each other }
